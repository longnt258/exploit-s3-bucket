**1. Definition:**
- An attack vector (threat vector) is a way for attackers to enter a network or system.
- Common attack vectors:
  + Social engineering attacks.
  + Credential theft.
  + Vulnability exploits.

**2. Most common attack vectors:**
- **Phishing**: [Phishing](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/phishing-attack/) involves stealing data, such as user's password. Attackers gain access to this data by tricking the victim into revealing it. (ex: ransomware attack).
  
- **Email attachments**: Email attachment can contain malicious code that executes after a user opens the file. (ex: [Ryuk](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/ransomware/ryuk-ransomware/) attack).
- **Account takeover**: Attackers can steal a user's credential (username and password) via phishing attack, brute force attack, or purchasing them on the undergroud market. Attackers can also try to intercept and use a session cookie to impersonate the user to a web application.
- **Lack of encryption**: Unencrypted data can be viewed by anyone who has access to it. It can be intercepted in transit between networks, as in an [on-path attack](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/on-path-attack/), or simply viewed inadvertently by an intermediary along the network path.
- **Insider threats**: An insider threat is when a known and trusted user accesses and distributes confidential data, or enables an attacker to do the same. Such occurrences can be either intentional or accidental on the part of the user. External attackers can try to create insider threats by contacting insiders directly and asking, bribing, tricking, or threatening them into providing access. Sometimes malicious insiders act of their own accord, out of dissatisfaction with their organization or for some other reason.
- **Vulnerability exploits**: A vulnerability is a flaw in software or hardware. When an attacker successfully uses a vulnerability to enter a system, this is called a vulnerability "exploit." Applying the software or hardware vendor's updates can fix most vulnerabilities. But some vulnerabilities are "[zero-day](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/zero-day-exploit/)" vulnerabilities â€” unknown vulnerabilities for which there is no known fix.
- **Browser-based attacks**: To display webpages, Internet browsers load and execute code they receive from remote servers. Attackers can inject malicious code into a website or direct users to a fake website, tricking the browser into executing code that downloads [malware](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/malware/) or otherwise compromises user devices. With cloud computing, employees often access data and applications solely through their Internet browser, making this threat vector of particular concern.
- **Application compromise**: Instead of going after user accounts directly, an attacker may aim to infect a trusted third-party application with malware. Or they could create a fake, malicious application that users unknowingly download and install (a common attack vector for mobile devices).
- **Open ports**: A [port](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-computer-port/) is a virtual entryway into a device. Ports help computers and servers associate network traffic with a given application or process. Ports that are not in use should be closed. Attackers can send specially crafted messages to open ports to try to compromise the system, just as a car thief might try opening doors to see if any are unlocked.
  
**3. How can an organization secure its attack vectors?**
- Good security practices.
- Encryption.
- Browser isolation.
- Patching vulnerabilities.
- Secure access service edge (SASE).
