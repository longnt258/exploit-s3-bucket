**1. On-Premise:** refers to IT systems, software, or infrastructure that are hosted and managed locally within an organization's own facilities, rather than being provided or hosted by an external service provider.

**2. On-Cloud:** (often referred to as "cloud-based") refers to IT systems, software, and infrastructure that are hosted, managed, and delivered over the internet by external service providers, rather than being maintained on-premise by the organization itself.

**3. Attack vector on-premise and on-cloud:**
- **Network**:
  - **On-Premise**: Exploit vulnerabilities from poorly configured firewalls or unpatched network devices...
  - **On-Cloud**: Exploit misconfigurations in VPCs, security groups, ACLs,...
- **Authentication and Access Control:**
  - **On-Premise**: Steal user's credential, exploit vulnerabilities to gain higher levels of access (privilege escalation)...
  - **On-Cloud**: Misconfigured IAM roles or policies, steal authentication tokens or API keys.
- **Application and Service Vulnerabilities:**
  - **On-Premise**: Exploit vulnerabilities in internally hosted applications or services...
  - **On-Cloud**: Exposed storage buckets or improperly secured APIs.
- **Data Security:**
  - **On-Premise**: Thief or loss of physical storage device that contain sensitive data.
  - **On-Cloud**: Misconfigured cloud storage or database services can lead to unauthorized data exposure.
- **Insider Threats:**
  - **On-Premise**: Employees or contractors with access to internal system might misuse their access or steal data.
  - **On-Cloud**: Potential threats from cloud service provider staff, though access to customer data is typically restricted.

**4. Attack surface on-premise and on-cloud:**
- **Infrastructure**:
  - **On-Premise**: Physical access to servers, network devices and data centers can be exploited.
  - **On-Cloud**: Exposed endpoints and APIs in cloud services can be targeted if not properly secured.
- **Network**:
  - **On-Premise**: Risks from internal communications and data transfer, especially if not properly encrypted.
  - **On-Cloud**: Potential for interception of data transmitted over public or unsecured networks.
- **Systems and Services:**
  - **On-Premise**: Exploits targeting locally hosted applications or services, including unpatched software or known vulnerabilities.
  - **On-Cloud**: Exploits due to misconfigured cloud services or risks related to unsecured or improperly managed APIs that interact with cloud services.
- **Access Control:**
  - **On-Premise**: Risks associated with weak or compromised authentication mechanisms for accessing on-premise systems.
  - **On-Cloud**: IAM Misconfigurations
