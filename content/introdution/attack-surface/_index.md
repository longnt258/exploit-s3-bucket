**1. Definition:**
- An attack surface is all the points of entry and vulnerabilities an attacker can exploit to infiltrate a network or a system. It is essentially like all the doors and windows in a house — the more doors and windows a house has, the more potential entry points for a break-in. Understanding a network’s attack surface is critical — by knowing where the vulnerabilities are and monitoring it accordingly, an organization can reduce their attack surface and make it much harder for attackers to penetrate and compromise systems.

**2. The components of an attack surface:**
- **Digital attack surface** includes networks and services, such as ports, codes and wireless connections.
- **Physical attack surface** includes endpoint devices like USB ports and laptops.
- **Social engineering attack surface** refers to targeting personnel or employees such as phishing or ransomware attempts.

**3. The strategies which organizations implement to reduce their attack surface?**
- Regular vulnerability assessment and penetration testing to identify system weakness and keeping software and operating systems up to date with the latest security patches.
